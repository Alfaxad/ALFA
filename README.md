ALFA is an artificial life simulation system designed to explore and model the behaviors of heterogeneous swarms of agents with diverse roles, shapes, and capabilities. By leveraging concepts from artificial life and bio-inspired AI, ALFA aims to push beyond traditional swarm simulations, enabling complex and adaptable behaviors applicable to real-world robotics and AI research.
